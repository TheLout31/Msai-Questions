      <h2>Client & Server Communication</h2>
      <p>
        In an Operating System, <strong> Server Communication</strong> refers to
        the exchange of data and Services among multiple machines or processes.
        In Client client-server communication System one process or machine acts
        as a client requesting a service or data, and Another machine or process
        acts like a server for providing those Services or Data to the client
        machine. This Communication model is widely used for exchanging data
        among various computing environments like
        <strong
          >Systems, Internet Applications, and Networking Application
          communication</strong
        >. The communication between Server and Client takes place with
        different Protocols and mechanisms.

        <h3>The Journey of the Web Request</h3>
        <p>
          <em>A Web request</em>, starting with a user entering a URL, travels
          from the client (browser) to a server, and then back. This journey
          involves DNS resolution, TCP connection establishment, HTTP
          request/response, and potentially TLS encryption if HTTPS is used.
